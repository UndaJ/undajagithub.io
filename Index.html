    <p>The merchant players in <b> <i>Port Royal</i></b>, which won the Austrian Game Designers Competition under the title <i>HÃ¤ndler der Karibik</i>, are trying to earn as much as they can out of the Caribbean Sea, but if they set their goals too high, they might take home nothing for the day.

<img src="Carcassone.jpg" alt="Carcassone">
<p><b><i>Carcassonne</i></b> is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

<p><strong>The Mind</strong> is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.

<!-- Among Us-->
<img src="AmongUs.jpg" alt="AmongUs">
<p> In space, no one will hear you scream. In the case of <strong>Among Us</strong>, you and your fellow astronauts are stuck in a rut and now you must either escape a dying space station or restore it back to full operation. However, one of you is unlike the others. While the rest may want to fix the station as fast as possible, among one (up to three) of you has one intention: Kill everybody that tries to restore order. The only way to take the impostor out is through voting. But, will the crew vote out the killer or someone who was innocent all this time?
